# How to install AutoCodes without (.exe) version w/ compiling
Head over to [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com),
click download, then select v1.1.

Once installed, open it.
Run it as admin, or if prompted select yes.

Choose your preferred installation method and done!

> For Compile Users:

*For custom installations, select the "Install script compiler" if not already.*

Open the install location directory via a file explorer.
> C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey is the default for express installation.

Open the "Compiler" folder and open Ahk2Exe.exe.


Should be pretty straight forward after that.
> ANSI (A32) doesn't support emojis and may break certain parts of the script, it is recommended to use the (U64/32) to compile.
